I am good at rationalizing (i.e. avoiding the deeper interrogation of) things in my head, but worse at doing so when they are materialized (e.g. written down). I would like to use this space as a tool to help me process, without the quick escape hatch provided by the inherent limitations of working memory.

I'm not quite sure why this collection is to be public. It certainly isn't created as an advertisement to anyone, likely quite the opposite. I think writing from the position that the content is nominally available to others may help me to be more clear in how I express myself (and perhaps this is just another [[performance]], in which I will continue to avoid processing things that are painful to process).

The existence of this collection is bad [opsec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_security), of course. I've long toyed with the hypothetical situation that all of my actions and thoughts were public, and thought about how that would change the way I experience my world. Perhaps this collection is a test run :)

Writing is interesting because people can experience what you've created multiple times, just as you created it. You can't truly hear a speech after it's been delivered, a joke never lands as hard on youtube as it did in the bar last night. But you can read a book (or an online note) over and over, picking it apart like a salad with an ingredient you don't like. I don't like capers.
