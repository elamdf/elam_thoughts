# what I think leadership is, fundamentally
leading is about handling and disseminating partial information. Regardless of if you're leading volunteers, employees, or friends, you have
- a goal
- (some of) the information required to achieve that goal
- a group of people, with varrying abilities and time/attention budgets
being an effective leader is about working with those you're leading to allow them to contribute to your goal while
- feeling engaged, both in the goal and their part of its implementation
- like their time is respected
- like their abilities are utilized

# Why do I lead? 
- I don't [[trust]] anyone else to
- it's easier to lead people towards achieving a goal myself than to accurately and clearly describe the goal to others (who could lead people to the goal as well)
- I want to maintain some sense ownership/credit/engagement over an idea of mine, but cannot alone see it through
- leadership affords the maximum leverage (impact per time)
- leadership is an opportunity to allow others to succeed doing something they may not otherwise be able to succeed at with the skills they have

should write more about how I think about giving [[advice]]

should also write about how to lead with strength and confidence while cultivating others to lead, and not smothering those with new ideas
