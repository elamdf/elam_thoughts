Performance has (sometimes in retrospect, sometimes in the moment) always been a big thing for me. I'm not quite sure why, nor do I know if I was born to perform (or if it's a coping mechanism for some vague/unknown stressor).

I think performance (and consequently fantasy) is a beautiful embrace of subjectivity.

Absolute truth is rarely, if ever, the most important consideration :3

There's a Deleuze quote I put as my high school yearbook quote about truth, I should find it. Perhaps I understood parts of myself more deeply back then than I give myself retrospective credit for.

Update: I found it. Turns out apparently it was something that he translated, rather than his actual thought. I suppose the content of the quote applies to its attribution as well, though :)

> So you understand, when you have such an idea, the important is not to know wether it is true or false. The question is to know if it is important, if it is interesting, and if it is beautiful.
