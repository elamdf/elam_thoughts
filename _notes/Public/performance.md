Performance has (sometimes in retrospect, sometimes in the moment) always been a big thing for me. I'm not quite sure why, nor do I know if I was born to perform (or if it's a coping mechanism for some vague/unknown stressor).

I think performance (and consequently fantasy) is a beautiful embrace of subjectivity.

Absolute truth is rarely, if ever, the most important consideration :3

There's a Deleuze quote I put as my high school yearbook quote about truth, I should find it. Perhaps I understood parts of myself more deeply back then than I give myself retrospective credit for.
