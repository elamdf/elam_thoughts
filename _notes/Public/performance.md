Performance has (sometimes in retrospect, sometimes in the moment) always been a big thing for me. I'm not quite sure why, nor do I know if I was born to perform (or if it's a coping mechanism for some vague/unknown stressor).

I think performance is a beautiful embrace of subjectivity. [[leadership]] is performance. Being a partner, at times, is performance. I don't think this is bad or disingenuine. 

To perform is to provide a fantasy, in the broad sense of the word. That fantasy may be that everything is okay, that there's nothing to worry about. This may be provided to a lover or an employeee.

I don't see this inherently as being dishonest or bad as some might, rather (potentially) as an act of compassion and service. The world is messy. This sentiment certainly also enshrines the performances of 'bad' leaders (i.e. leaders with wrong motives/goals), but I believe that to be an issue of alignment rather than one of leadership.

Performance is freeing, for it is a fantasy of release for both the actor and the crowd. how poetic is it that we can gift this release to others?

There's a Deleuze quote I put as my high school yearbook quote about truth, I should find it. Perhaps I understood parts of myself more deeply back then than I give myself retrospective credit for.

Update: I found it. Turns out apparently it was something that he translated, rather than his actual thought. I suppose the content of the quote applies to its attribution as well, though :)

> So you understand, when you have such an idea, the important is not to know wether it is true or false. The question is to know if it is important, if it is interesting, and if it is beautiful.
