\[This is a response to the prompt "_Where in your life are you improvisational?_"]

In this response, I am going to use the words 'performance' and 'improvisation' interchangeably, taking 'performance' here as it's used in 'performativity'. I think the term 'improvisation' has a more narrow connotation than what I am attempting to convey.

Social reality as performance/performativity is not a particularly controversial claim amongst most audiences (so long as you care to steer free of certain phrases that evoke undesired implications to some). I would thus like to focus here on my experience with taking explicitly interaction as performance, rather than restating what Judith Butler stated much more eloquently 35 years ago, that is that social reality is a illusion constantly created "through language, gesture, and all manner of symbolic social sign"[0].

I did not develop a strong individual social intuition growing up and learned to navigate social dynamics more by pattern matching than any deeper reasoning. As a 15 year old, for example, I was more comfortable talking to new graduate students than strangers my age (not because I was more 'mature' or anything to that effect, but because the range of acceptable/expected behaviors in social dynamics of older people is smaller and thus easier for me to learn).

Things are not as rigid now as I've developed (the difference between 'real learning' and simply finding more patterns to match to is a hot debate these days), but I find it fruitful to realize that social interaction is providing an experience for others as much as it is gaining a connection with them- sometimes there is a conscious cultivation of that experience, sometimes the experience is a direct projection of the unconscious.

I see conscious cultivation as improvisation on a theme- that is, 'you are a strong leader', 'you are a supportive partner' etc. It is a fundamentally playful experience, and while there may be nominally serious scenarios your character navigates, fundamentally you are playing a part towards the end goal of connection.

Isn't this tiring? I'm not sure, I see it not as forcing myself into a certain identity, but as a lens through which I can explore which experiences I want to curate.

I'm also not sure how much of this is an intellectualization to overcompensate (not an uncommon occurrence) for my fear of being perceived soley as a spectacle- a little of that is fine, even desired but there needs to be some underlying respect/compassion.
